## About Me
I am a Ph.D. student at the National University of Singapore (NUS), School of Computing. I am supervised by [Prof. Dong Jin Song](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~dongjs/) and [Prof. Lin Yun](http://linyun.info/). My research interests lie in machine learning, AI with actionable explanations, and dataset quality.
